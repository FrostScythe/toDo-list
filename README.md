# Todo List Web App

This was my first project with backend (mongo DB).
A simple web application that allows users to create todo lists and manage tasks.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

3. You will see a default list titled "Today" with some pre-populated tasks. You can add new tasks by clicking the "+" button, and you can delete a task by clicking on the checkbox next to it.

4. To create a custom list, enter the desired list name in the URL after the `/`, e.g., `http://localhost:3000/work`.
